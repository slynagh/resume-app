            I am a digital creative professional looking to focus my career as a front-end developer.
            </p>
            <p>
            My main strengths are versatility and resourcefulness. I have a broad range of skills from a career which covers animation, illustration and multimedia to IT support â€“ which are complimentary to my strong front end fundamentals. I am always happy to pick up a new tool to apply to a solution.            </p>
            <p>
            Having recently moved to the Netherlands I'm especially interested in working with agile, test-driven teams on challenging cross platform projects, delivering innovative solutions via continuous integration techniques.
