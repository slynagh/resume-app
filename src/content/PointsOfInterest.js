      I have a passion for music and I’ve played drums, guitar and bass in many
      bands over the years. most notably Brisbane cult rock legends Giants of
      Science, with whom I’ve written and recorded 3 albums, 4 EPs, and toured
      Australia countless times. I was also a member of Mendix’s in-house covers
      band during my time with the company.
